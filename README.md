# Zbyner
File encryption with Python

Hi guys....
Now is the time to encrypt your personal files
I wrote this code to encrypt zip files:))))
The first version of this program seemed acceptable
But this code has not been confirmed yet. Please take a backup of your data and then proceed with encryption
Lock and unlock different files and if you encounter any problem, let us know so that we can solve your problem in the next versions.
# Lockfile
Zip the files you want and in the address ./The location of the code file/Data/Unlock copy
Import or run the code and enter the following command:
Zbyner.Unlockbyner('File name' , 'File name after encryption') +(No extension)+
After encryption, the program closes
Go to the address below and get your encrypted file:
./The location of the code file/Data/Lock/File name after encryption
# Unlock
To unlock, first place the files in the path below:
./The location of the code file/Data/Lock
Then run or import the program and enter the following command:
Zbyner.Lock('File name','File name after decryption')
After decryption, the program closes
Go to the address below and get your decryption file:
./The location of the code file/Data/Unlock/File name after decryption

# how to work
When you encrypt a file, you actually damage the zipped file.
The code restores damaged files.
Only files damaged by the code.
If you encrypt important information, be sure to open it again and test it.
